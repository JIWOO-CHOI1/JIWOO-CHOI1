### 🤞 Nice way to meet me

<p>
  👋&nbsp; Hello, I'm Jiwoo, currently majoring in statistics. I have been studying hard to become a data analyst for the past four years. In particular, among the various areas of data analysis, we are very interested in computer vision (Vision), natural language processing (NLP), and recommendation systems.<br/>
  Data analysis is the process of discovering hidden patterns and insights from data. This allows you to make decisions by analyzing and understanding data. These capabilities are applicable in a variety of areas, and can play an important role, especially in social fields such as healthcare, healthcare, and the economy.<br/>
  I was very interested in solving complex problems using machine learning and deep learning technology, so I studied data analysis. In the future, we want to gain more knowledge and experience to contribute and achieve success in data analytics💖.<br/>
